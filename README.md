# Would You Rather Project

Would You Rather is a React-Redux project for Udacity's React Fundamental course. This web app lets a user to play the "Would You Rather?" game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. Users can answer existing questions, post their own questions, see how other people have voted, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. The backend is simulated by `_.Data.js`, which represent a fake database.

## TL;DR

To run the app right away:

* make sure node and npm are installed and up to date
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
